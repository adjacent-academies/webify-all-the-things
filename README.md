# webify-all-the-things

> _thanks @ansadler for the great idea!_

this repo represents a small experiment to help us practice **Problem Solving with JavaScript** &trade; while also practicing with HTML, CSS and client-side JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation and events.

```js
 const button = document.querySelector("button")
 button.addEventListener('click', () => console.log("the button was clicked!"))
```

there are two examples based on the same [edabit challenge](https://edabit.com/challenge/erFxBbqzZPSegMwnc) in this repo at the moment:

1. `changeEnough.simple.html` paired with `js/changeEnough.simple.js`
2. `changeEnough.html` paired with `js/changeEnough.js`

to start working with this code:

1. clone this repo
2. open the files in an editor like Visual Studio Code
3. run LiveServer (or similar) on either of the two HTML files
4. have fun!
